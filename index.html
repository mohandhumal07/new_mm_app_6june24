The initial and the most difficult risk we need to take is to become honest.","Nature has given us all the pieces required to achieve exceptional wellness and health, but has left it to us to put these pieces together.","Success is peace of mind, which is a direct result of self-satisfaction in knowing you made the effort to become the best of which you are capable","Concentrate all your thoughts upon the work in hand.
